### Monthly Chart:

- Price has swept a monthly structural liquidity and is currently bullish.
- I'm expecting price to target the monthly range high over the next coming months.

### Weekly Chart:

![[Pasted image 20250622113639.png]]

- Price has broken a bearish range high.
- I will be monitoring price in order to see if whether price will retrace to fill the FVG that's lower in the new dealing range.

### Daily Chart:

- There isn't a lot of price to work with on the daily chart as the market structure swings are not "schematically" chartable, there's no proper CHoCH/BOS so price can potentially break above the high.
- I'm observing how price will react from that high that I've marked out.

### Four Hour Chart:

- I'm expecting price to retrace in order to fill the FVG.
