- Liquidity is money.
- There are three types of liquidity:
	- Inducement Liquidity
	- Structural Liquidity
	- Transactional Liquidity

###### What is Inducement Liquidity?
- Is used for expansions.
- Inducements only happen when there is no Structural Liquidity.
- If price is bullish and you don't see Structural Liquidity, the low that's supposed to be protected, isn't protected and will likely be taken out. The low that gets taken out becomes the Inducement Liquidity, after the low gets taken out price expands:

- Whenever you have no Structural Liquidity, anticipate the protected low to get taken out before expanding.

- How do we anticipate Inducement Liquidity?
	- Let's assume price is bearish and you want to follow the current trend but you need a swing structure, so you get a swing structure (sweep of the high + BOS).
	- You're only looking for sells, but in order to sell you need to see Structural Liquidity.
	- In the current swing there is no Structural Liquidity, that means that the high that's supposed to be protected is Inducement Liquidity and will get taken out.

###### What is Structural Liquidity?
- Is used for continuations.
- This is the most important type of liquidity for continuations (the last low/high before the main low/high).
- After a high has been taken out in a BOS, you expect a correction and then expansion but how do you enter your buy position? Where do you want to buy from?
- You focus on the this zone where the checkmark is because that is your discounted zone:

- Your main focus in price is where there is a sweep and BOS, even though there's more price action on the chart, for example: 
![[Structure_083844.png]]
- There's no sweeps in the structure that formed after the first sweep which means that the first sweep is a protected low. 
- Where the reversal happens becomes your high.
- The last low before the main low/high is your Structural Liquidity (this is for continuations):

- Immediately when price takes out that last low before the main low, you get an expansion:

- There are three types of Structural Liquidity because tends to move differently but it still means the same thing:
	- Type 1:

	- Type 2:
	![[Type 2_091728.png]]
	- Type 3 (similar to type 1 but you happen to see it before it happens):

- Whenever there is no Structural Liquidity, it's automatically Inducement Liquidity (which is more riskier to trade).
- Structural Liquidity works best when it's closer to our Discounted zone.

- The Do's and Don'ts of Structural Liquidity:
	- The Structural Liquidity must be close to the Discounted zone, either on 50% (Equilibrium) or below.
	- It must be 'A' or 'V' shaped, it must be obvious to spot it.

###### What is Transactional Liquidity?
- Is used for corrections.
- The high/low in a BOS is liquidity and is only transactional liquidity when the high/low gets taken out.
- When the high/low gets taken out you start anticipating a correction.
