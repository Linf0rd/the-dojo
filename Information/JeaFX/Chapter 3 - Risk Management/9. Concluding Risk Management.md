###### Multiple aspects of Risk Management: 
- Risk/reward ratios.
- Stop loss orders.

###### All aspects come together:

- One is not more important than the other.

- They are all essential.

- There's a process to follow for each trade you take.

###### The Risk Management process:
1. Keep your risk parameters close in mind.
2. Prepare your analysis with over a 1:1RR ratio (1:2/1:3+).
3. Find the ideal SL position level (how many pips).
4. Calculate position size for your risk % using a calculator.
