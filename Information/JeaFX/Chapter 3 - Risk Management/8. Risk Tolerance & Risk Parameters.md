- Your personal mental ability to manage risk & loss.

- For some it will be high for others it will be low.

- Your risk parameters will reflect your risk tolerance.

- You must remain realistic & logical with parameters regardless of your personal risk tolerance.

###### Risk Parameters:

- Guidelines, limits & targets for controlling risk.

- Ingrained in our trading plan & must be followed strictly.

- Parameters are at the foundation of discipline.

- Parameters will be personal in line with your risk tolerance.

###### Risk Parameters Examples:

- I will risk 'x%' per trade, every trade.
	- This is the most important principle of RM.
	- It must be strictly adhered to in order to maintain the RR strategy.
	- You choose a % and stick to it on every trade.
	- The golden number is 1-2%

- If I lose  'x%' I will pause trading for the day/week.

- If I make  'x%' I will pause trading for the week.

###### Why 2%?

- 2% is the perfect balance.

- At 2% risk its practically impossible to blow an account (depending on account size).

- 2% makes trades worthwhile, 1% can be a bit weak especially when using a smaller account.

- When you risk more than 2% on a $100 account:

###### When Trading Small:

- 4% risk is acceptable.

- 4% on a small account usually isn't stressful risk (e.g. trading a $100 account).

- Doubles account growth speed.

- Requires a stronger level of discipline & more patience.
