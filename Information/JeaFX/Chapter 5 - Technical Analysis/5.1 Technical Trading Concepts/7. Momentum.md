- Momentum helps with building an eye for the market.

- Helps you understand when is the best time to get in the market and when is it the time to stay out.

- It also helps you understand how strong the pressure is from a buying or selling perspective is.

- An example of momentum in a bearish trend:

	 - There's a lot more selling pressure than buying pressure.

- A reversal pattern from bearish to bullish:

- Momentum is best used to gauge the strength of the market and to find reversals.

- If you see the momentum slowing down towards high interest zones that shows us that the trend is ending, e.g. If the trend had been bullish and is now slowing down towards a bearish point of interest (POI), it means that the bullish trend is showing signs of weakness and might be ending especially when the bearish momentum starts picking up.

###### Market examples:

 - Bearish BOS with slow bullish trending momentum into the bearish imbalance and then strong bearish momentum.

- Strong bullish momentum breakout breaking multiple previous bearish structure after the bearish momentum slowed down at a demand zone.

- S&D in-line with structure & momentum.

	- Seeing such a strong momentum move gives you confidence that the buying pressure is strong and will continue pushing up.

- A breakout with slow momentum is not something worth pursuing as it doesn't hold a lot of strength.
