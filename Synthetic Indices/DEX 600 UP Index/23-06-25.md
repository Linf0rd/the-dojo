- On the monthly chart we only have a range high and a range low, there's no real break of market structure.
- Price is currently reacting from a low that's within the monthly range high and range low.

### Weekly Chart:

- On the weekly chart we have a sweep of the low + a market structure break.
- We also have structural liquidity, this is an ideal setup according to the schematic.
- I'm monitoring how price will react from the structural liquidity.
