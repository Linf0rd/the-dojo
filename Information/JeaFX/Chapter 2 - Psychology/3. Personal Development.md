###### Becoming the best version of yourself:

- Trading is a lifestyle & a personal journey.

- Self-development is necessary for long-term success.

- Become the master of your mindset.

###### Deprogramming:

- Understanding the program:
	- Most people are programmed into the system.
	- You are domesticated from birth by family & authority.
	- School & society set subliminal expectations. (e.g. You have to go to school, you have to go to university, you have to get a job, etc.).
	- Working a job for someone else (exchanging your time for money).
	- Filling your spare time with unproductive entertainment (e.g. Doomscrolling on social media, playing video games, etc.).
	- Poisoning your body (drugs, alcohol, junk food, etc.).

- Do these set of programs look or sound familiar to you?

- For most people: formal education is the final education.
	- What is meant by this?
		-  School
		- College
		- Apprenticeships
		- University
	- These are normally the things we do before we start working/getting a job.
	- After we have completed formal education, we generally don't educate ourselves further after that.

- Very few people actually work on themselves and their minds after the formal education is finished.

- Most people just drift through life, just passing time like they will get it back.
	- This is not okay when you're a trader as you're always forced to work on yourself.
	- Mindset rules all & mastering yourself is crucial.

- With that being said, it doesn't mean that you should give up on your entertainment. It simply means that you should do it in moderation.
