- Entries aren't everything but they can massively improve RR.

- Two types of entries: Risk & Confirmation.

- Risk entries are riskier because you place buy or sell limits at HTF S&D/IMB zones that are high interest areas.
	- More likely to get stopped out than confirmation entries.

- Confirmation entries are safer entries as they require some LTF BOS before you enter a trade.
	- Normally you wait for price to approach a zone on the HTF and then you find the structure on the LTF.
	- Sometimes you will miss trades because price won't always retrace back into a zone on the LTF.

###### Market examples:

- Price is making LLs & LHs and there's a large IMB that hasn't been filled yet, this is an example of a risk entry as we're expecting price to make another LH into the supply zone and continue lower.

- Focus on market structure, liquidity, order flow, imbalances & identifying high interest zones.

- Bearish market with BOS, liquidity and strong downward momentum.

	-  Expecting liquidity to be taken.
	- Price to retrace back into the supply zone (high interest zone).
	- There's an imbalance below the supply zone.

- Heading over to the LTF you can see how price is making HHs & HLs as it was busy trending upward, it tapped into midway of the HTF supply and broke structure on the LTF.

- You're looking for a confirmation entry on the LTF.
