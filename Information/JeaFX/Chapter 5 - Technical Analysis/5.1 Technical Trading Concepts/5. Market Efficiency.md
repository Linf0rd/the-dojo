- Which of the two demand zones do you thing you should focus on?

	- It can be tempting to go with the second one which is higher, a lot of the time this zone will work out. 
	- However, more of the time the zone below that one will work because it is an imbalanced zone.

- Most of the time S&D zones are retested, when price forms a demand zone, moves away and forms a new demand zone without retesting the first one. Price will most commonly push through the second one to tap into the first one.

	- This is due to something called Market Efficiency.

- There two phases a market can be in:

	- Efficient Price Action (PA).
		- Is when price moves away from a zone and retests it.
		- Efficient price happens because came back to collect the orders that was resting in a zone and there's no injection of orders higher up.
	
	- Inefficient Price Action.
		- Is when the market forms a zone and fails to retest it, that leaves an area open that's called inefficient pricing.

		- This usually happens because of an injection of buying pressure that happens above the demand zone but the markets move based on orders.
		- If there's a large amount of buying orders in a demand zone that hasn't been tested yet and there's not so many buying orders at the zone that was formed second, it will be violated.
		- Just because the second zone was broken, doesn't mean its a trend shift.

		- Price just came down to recollect all those orders that wasn't filled yet.

###### Market examples

- Inefficient price area with untested swing structure supply zone:

- Since price can potential retrace to the downside as there are inefficient pricing. Its best to focus on both zones as price can essentially tap into both of them.

- Price broke through the second demand zone because there's an imbalance at the first demand zone:

# Market Efficiency and Imbalances in Trading

This lesson explains the concepts of market efficiency and imbalances, demonstrating how they influence price action and can be integrated into a trading strategy alongside supply and demand zones and market structure. The instructor uses real-life trading examples to illustrate these concepts.

## Efficient vs. Inefficient Price Action

The instructor introduces two types of market behavior: efficient and inefficient price action. → Efficient price action is characterized by the market retesting a supply or demand zone after moving away from it. → This is considered the cleanest and easiest price action to trade. → Inefficient price action, on the other hand, occurs when the market fails to retest a zone after moving away, leaving an "imbalance" or a gap in price. → This often happens due to a sudden influx of buying or selling pressure. →

## Understanding Imbalances

Imbalances are explained as areas of untested or inefficient pricing. → They occur when a significant price movement leaves a gap between a newly formed demand or supply zone and a previous, untested one. → The instructor emphasizes that these imbalances are typically filled before the market continues its overall trend. → This filling process involves the market collecting buy or sell orders within the imbalanced zone, which can lead to strong price movements once the imbalance is resolved. →

## Trading with Imbalances and Market Structure

The instructor then connects these concepts to a practical trading scenario. → Using a chart example, they identify a downtrend (swing structure) with a bullish substructure within it. → A key supply zone is identified as a potential selling area. → However, due to an observed imbalance below the supply zone, the instructor advises against selling immediately. → Instead, they suggest waiting for the imbalance to be filled, potentially even considering a buy trade within the bullish substructure towards the supply zone. →

## Practical Example: A Buy-Into-Sell Trade

The instructor zooms in on the hourly timeframe and identifies two potential buy zones: one at a previous break of structure and another within the imbalanced area. → They recommend watching both zones and entering a buy trade when price reaches either. → The example shows the market filling the lower imbalanced zone before moving up sharply, triggering the buy trade. → This upward movement fills the imbalance above, creating a selling opportunity at the original supply zone. → This "buy-into-sell" strategy demonstrates how imbalances can be used to identify both entry and exit points. →

## Key Takeaways

The instructor concludes by reiterating the importance of understanding market efficiency and imbalances. → Recognizing these imbalances allows traders to avoid premature entries, identify high-probability trading opportunities, and even determine target levels. → The lesson emphasizes the integration of these concepts with supply and demand and market structure to form a comprehensive trading system. → The instructor also previews the next lesson, which will cover the concept of liquidity. →
