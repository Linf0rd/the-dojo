- In the forex market we trade currencies, specifically currency pairs.

- A currency pair is a crossover of two currencies that allows us to buy or sell one against another currency (e.g. EURUSD, the most traded currency pair in the world; Euro/Dollar).
	- When we're buying, we're essentially betting that the price of the Euro will go up against the value of the Dollar.
	- When we're selling, we're essentially betting that the price of the Euro will go down against the value of the Dollar.

###### Currency Pairs:

- There are a lot of different currency pairs: majors, minors & exotics.

- Majors are the most traded currency pairs, major pairs have the best trade prices, spreads & commissions.
	- Major trading pairs include:
		- EURUSD (Euro/Dollar).
		- GBPUSD (Great Britain Pound/Dollar).
		- USDJPY (Dollar/Japanese Yen).
		- USDCHF (Dollar/Swiss Franc).

- Minors are pairs that are not associated with Dollar, they have slightly wider spreads and are not as liquid as majors.
	- Minor trading pairs include:
		- EURGBP (Euro/Great Britain Pound).
		- GBPAUD (Great Britain Pound/Australian Dollar).
		- EURJPY (Euro/Japanese Yen).
		- AUDJPY (Australian Dollar/Japanese Yen).

- Exotics are pairs of currencies that are considered to be of 'emerging markets', they have even wider spreads than minors and they are not as liquid as majors & minors.
