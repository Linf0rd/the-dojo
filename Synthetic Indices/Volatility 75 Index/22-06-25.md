- Price had been bearish since having swept the all time high to now having broken below the all time low.
- There is some bullish candles forming that will analyze in more detail on the lower charts.
- Price is currently reacting from a bullish monthly FVG.

### Weekly Chart:

- On the week chart we have a ChoCH with structural liquidity which hasn't been filled.
- Price hasn't broken the range high and seems to be struggling to do so.
- Bias is bullish but I'm expecting price to sweep the liquidity first and then continue going higher.


### Daily Chart: 

![[Pasted image 20250622100118.png]]

- Price is currently at a bearish FVG and the bullish momentum is slowing down.
- The last bearish leg had a strong down movement so I'm expecting price to do the same again; to break daily market structure and tap into the weekly structural liquidity.


### Four Hour Chart:

- The bearish momentum is much stronger than the bullish momentum.
- There's not a lot of price action to work with on the H4 chart at the moment.

### H1 Chart:
