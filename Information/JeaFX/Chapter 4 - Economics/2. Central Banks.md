- There are two things that you need to primarily follow from central banks:
	- Interest Rates
		- Interest rates are decided monthly by each central bank.
		- Interest rates reflect economic performance.
		- Interest rates help to determine sentiment (market direction).
		- You must review interest rate decisions every month:
			- Rate hike = hawkish (bullish).
			- No change = neutral.
			- Rate cut = dovish (bearish).

	- Monetary Policy
		- Policy statements are released with each rate decision.
		- Statements reveal the why behind rate decisions.
		- Can be used to help us determine currency direction.

###### Understanding Monetary Policy Statements:

- Statements talk about the current economic stance - all things considered. This includes:
	- Real world events.
	- Inflation/deflation.
	- Consumer spending.
	- Labour markets.
	- Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
	- Cost of living.

- An important economic overview is pulled together in the statement.
	- We can analyze what we read along with the interest rate decision to determine the direction a currency may trend in.

- The Interest Rates & Monetary Policy combined provides us with clarity and confidence to our trading:
