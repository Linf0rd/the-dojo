- Market structure is one of the most important trading concepts.

- The market moves in three phases:
	- Uptrend (Buying).
	- Consolidation (Caution).
	- Downtrend (Selling).

- The best way to trade, is to trade with the trend.

- An uptrend is defined by a series of highs and lows:
	![[Pasted image 20250420053458.png]]
	- When the market is making higher highs (HH) and higher lows (LL) it means that the market is trending up.
	- When the market is doing this you're only looking for buys with the trend.

- A downtrend is defined by a series of lows and highs:
	![[Pasted image 20250420053745.png]]
	- When the market is making lower lows (LL) and lower highs (LH) it means that the market is trending down.
	- When the market is doing this you're only looing for sells with the trend.

- You identify HH/HL in a trend by break of structure (BOS):

- The market moves in two phases:
	- Impulses
		- Its the large move that's in line with the trend.

	- Corrections
		- Are smaller movements that come after the impulses. 

- Market structure is essentially a battle between buyers and sellers.

###### Swing structure & Sub-structure

- Swing structure is the in-trend, impulsive leg of price:

	- Swing structure is the overall direction of a larger timeframe move.

- Sub-structure is the corrective leg of price:

- Sub-structure legs form trends within themselves.

- You can follow downtrends in the corrective move.

- Because markets have different timeframes, this means that there's going to be trends existing within all different timeframes within a sub-structure of larger trends.

- e.g. Let's say you're looking at a daily timeframe and you're in an uptrend. You would a large push to the upside, a pullback and then another push to the upside. Say you drop to the H1/H4 timeframe from the daily chart, you would see smaller downtrends happening in the corrective move:

	- These trends can be traded themselves when you drop down to the lower timeframes.
	- Within the sub-structure you get full trends on different timeframes.

- Everything is sort of timeframe relative:
	- Where you may see one trend on the daily timeframe, there's going to be many smaller trends on the lower timeframe, e.g. H1/H4.


###### Real market examples

- GBPJPY H4:
	![[Pasted image 20250420061117.png]]
	
-  Looking at the trend, you were previously in an uptrend until %% 15 Oct 21 | 14:00 | 157.335 %% at this point we had a HH, an HL and another HH and then we started to break through and made LLs:
	![[Pasted image 20250420062024.png]]
	- This is where the trend broke and this is where you're supposed to mark your first BOS.

- From there on you had price making LLs and LHs, which means that price is trending down:
	![[Pasted image 20250420062451.png]]
	- So you know, if you're trading from this timeframe and you're trading this structure you want to be moving with the trend.

- Generally what you'd want to first wait for a break of structure and then you look to sell/buy on the pullback.

- Not every single time is going to give you good trading ideas.

- On the flip side if you we're in an uptrend, you'd wait for an HH and then you buy at the HL:

- If you drop to lower timeframes e.g. 15m in a retracement leg of the the swing downtrend you can actually see how on the 15m there's an uptrend occurring:
	![[Pasted image 20250420063243.png]]
	- Generally you just want to trade the sub-structure through the range of the swing structure.

###### Structure reversals

- How do you actually find the place where the market shifts from one trend to another?
	![[Pasted image 20250420063745.png]]
	- At the end of an uptrend you're going to see something like this â¬†.
	- What this actually shows is a change in the trend, first indicated by a BOS.
	- When you have an impulse that's larger than the bullish impulse and actually breaks the structure through forming a LL that's when you get a reversal:
	 ![[Pasted image 20250420064031.png]]
	- Its not going to be this neat all the time.
	- This one way that you get into trades and can be used as an exit as well (when you're already in a trade).

###### What's next?

- Go to live charts and identify HHs & HLs
- Then identify LLs & LHs.

- Identify Bullish & Bearish trends.

- Look for the reversals.

- Look for consolidations, they are used as a gauge to see if whether the market is in a good position to trade or not.

- Train your eye for the market:
