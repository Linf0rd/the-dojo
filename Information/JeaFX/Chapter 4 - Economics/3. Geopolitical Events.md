- Geopolitical events are real world events that effect the economy.

###### How do they affect the markets?

- Geopolitical events cause uncertainty for market participants.

- They can dramatically strengthen or weaken a currency.
	- A recession can weigh on a currency for a long time.
	- Rising Oil prices will boost CAD against other currencies because Canada is one of the biggest oil producers in the world.

- Geopolitical events can cause changes in supply & demand for a currency.
	- If a currency is weak, it will lose its demand.
	- When a currency is strong, demand enters the market taking up the supply.

- Changes in supply & demand causes a change in currency value.
	- When demand falls currencies become less sought after, the value falls in suit.
	- If demand rises, supply's bought up making a currency rise in value.
