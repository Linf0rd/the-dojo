### Monthly Chart:

- On the monthly chart we have a break of structure but there's no sweep of the previous low.
- All the previous lows are structural liquidity as there's no real sweep of the previous lows.

### Weekly Chart:

- Those previous lows are all structural liquidity, price may want to sweep into a monthly structural liquidity zone before going long.
- This bullish FVG that I'm selling from doesn't hold much significance that's why I'm not buying.

### Daily Chart:

- Buying pressure is low at the moment.
- Price broke the last range low and is now continuing lower.
- I'm expecting price to take out the sweep + structure break as there is no structural liquidity.
