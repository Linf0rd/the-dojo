### Monthly Chart:

- On the monthly chart, we're currently bearish, price broke structure around 6318, shifting the structure from bullish to bearish.
- Price broke structure to the downside around 6108.
- I have outlined the monthly range that I'm currently working with, if price breaks the high of the range, then we know that the trend is shifting from bearish to bullish.

### Weekly Chart:

- On the weekly chart we're in a bearish trend, I have outlined the range that I'm looking at.
- Price swept the high of the weekly range and before price sold of, it created structural liquidity.
- Price then sold off, retraced and is now reacting from the structural liquidity and the bearish POI.
- If price breaks above the range high, then the market has shifted bias.

### Daily Chart:

![[Pasted image 20250618183651.png]]

- Price is currently reacting from the weekly structural liquidity which is essentially a swept high on the daily timeframe.
- Price swept into the weekly structural liquidity and broke structure on the daily timeframe after having been bullish and is now trending lower.
- We have untapped daily structural liquidity in the bullish trend and I'm expecting price to go lower in order to fill those FVGs around the daily structural liquidity.


### Four Hour Chart:

- On the four hour chart we have a bullish trend with the bulls showing strong momentum.
- I also see that there's an untapped FVG with H4 structural liquidity in the previous leg of price, I'm expecting price to go and fill that FVG and then continue going down towards the daily FVGs and structural liquidity.
- The four hour FVG is relatively small, in order to see it I need to zoom the chart (TradingView works best for this!).

### One Hour Chart Before:

![[Volatility 10 IndexH1.png]]

- The one hour chart is basically just a refinement of the four hour chart which shows the bullish breaks of structure.
- I've outlined one hour structural liquidity as well as an FVG on the one hour chart which price may want to tap into.
- I'm expecting price to go higher in order to fill the four hour FVG and tap into the four hour structural liquidity.

### One Hour Chart Update:

![[Pasted image 20250618191829.png]]
- Price has tapped into the one hour structural liquidity but not the FVG.
- Price can either shoot up from here or it can retrace to fill the FVG and then shoot up as price quickly moved away after tapping into the one hour structural liquidity.
- Alternatively price can invalidate this setup altogether.

### Setup Update:

- The setup got invalidated, price is breaking market structure.
- I will be monitoring price as it plays out, scouting for new trading opportunities.
- Price was delivering from the premium side so the setup wasn't going to hold.
