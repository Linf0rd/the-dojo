- Risk Management first begins in the mind.

- Before moving into the processes you must develop the mindset for longevity.

- You are trading to make consistent money, not have fun!

- You must understand from the start that success cannot be achieved without discipline.

- The market is King, if you don't adhere to your rules that you have set in place it will chew you up & spit you out.

- It is literally possible to lose any amount of money in a day.

###### Why are you trading?

- Are you here for long term success or is trading just a game to you? Think about that for a second.
	- If you're really serious about long term growth, don't play about.
	- Don't break your rules.
	- Follow the processes, that's the next step to success.
