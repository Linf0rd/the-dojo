- Let's say we're in a bullish trend and we have a zone that we'd like to buy from and we find that the zone is too big, we can refine it so that we don't have a big SL and don't be in deep drawdown.

- POI falls into two categories:
	- A - Risk Entry

	- B - Confirmation Entry

- We work with two Quasimodo entries:
	- Quasimodo Reversal (QMR)
	- Quasimodo Continuation (QMC)

- What is Quasimodo Reversal?
	- An Order Block that has failed, if an OB has been taken out it doesn't mean that the OB has been invalidated, it becomes a QMR. 

- Bullish Quasimodo Setup with Structural Liquidity:

- An order block is the last bearish candle in a bullish move and the last bullish candle in a bearish move.

- Bullish Quasimodo Reversal (QMR) Entry (Weekly TF):
	- Sweep of low with BOS.
	- Retracement to OB in Discounted zone and then expands.
