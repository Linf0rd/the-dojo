- On the daily chart there isn't much going on at the moment.
- We have this sweep + potential CHoCH which I'm monitoring.
- Within that bearish leg of price there's a POI that hasn't been tapped into.

### Four Hour Chart:

- Current market structure on the four hour chart is bearish.
- I'm expecting price to retrace back into this FVG which is a refinement of the daily POI.
