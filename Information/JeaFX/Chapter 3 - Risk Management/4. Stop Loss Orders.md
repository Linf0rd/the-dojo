- A Stop Loss order is a level where losing trades cut off to prevent a loss growing.

- It must be used to control risk on each trade.

- Works as part of the overall 'RR' strategy.

- To comply with your RR strategy, you must pre-plan stop loss orders.

- Select a logical cut-off point based on technicals.

- Your stop loss must be kept firmly in place.
	- Moving your stop loss can lead to inflated losses.
	- Removing your stop loss can lead to infinite losses.

###### Utilising Stop Loss Orders:

- You can use SL orders in order to protect profits.
	- When a trade is in profit, you will move your SL to entry.
	- When the trade runs deep enough you can move your SL further to protect profits.
