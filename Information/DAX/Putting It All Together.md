##### Which zones do you trade from?

- On the Weekly timeframe start with the current swing (a swing is when you can an obvious BOS):

- Weekly swing structure indicating that price is bearish:

- Price is currently in a discounted zone and needs to retrace back into the premium zone in order for price to start expanding to the low side again:

- Seeing that price is going to retrace to the last high before the main high we can look for long opportunities based on the current structure:
![[Bullish Weekly Sweep_023838.png]]
- Weekly sweep of low with BOS.
- The last bearish candle is the POI.
- We can now look for opportunities on the lower timeframes (we can look for counter-trend opportunities as we already know that price is going to retrace back into the bullish POI).
- Wait for a BOS and sweep on the higher timeframe to know that the trend has really changed.
