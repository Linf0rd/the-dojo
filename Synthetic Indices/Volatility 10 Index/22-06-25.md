### Chart Update

- Price hasn't tapped in to the FVG, however I remain optimistic because price can still retrace up to the FVG as it is an area of interest. 
- We have trendline liquidity at play, I'm expecting price to hit the bottom trendline, tapping into the structural liquidity from the buyers' side and then pushing up.
