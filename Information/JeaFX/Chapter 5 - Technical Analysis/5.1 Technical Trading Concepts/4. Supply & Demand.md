- Supply & Demand is a very important concept in your trading.

- Supply & Demand refers to areas in the market where buy orders or sell orders are accumulating.

- When you hit a Supply or Demand zone, the market normally reacts fast from it in a given direction.

- If you use what was spoken about in the previous lesson ([Market Structure][obsidian://open?vault=The%20Dojo%F0%9F%A7%A7&file=Chapter%205%20-%20Technical%20Analysis%2F5.1%20Technical%20Trading%20Concepts%2F3.%20Market%20Structure]) and consider this as an uptrend. What you can do is identify Demand zones with the trend and you can use this to buy from.

- The BOS can lead us to find the demand zone that broke the structure and focus on that for buys.

	- Wait for a HH and a retracement back into demand zone.

- The exact same opposite is a Supply zone in a bearish trend.

- Most traders are programmed to trade Support & Resistance (S&R) which is basically levels where price bounces off multiple times.
	![[Pasted image 20250420081751.png]]
	- This doesn't actually work most of the time because the market is going to follow S&D.
	- Let's say you had a supply zone above the resistance and you were in a downtrend, what you would see a lot times is price tapping into that supply zone and then selling off instead of from the resistance.

	- S&R becomes redundant when you understand the concept of S&D.

- If you consider the following demand zone:
	![[Pasted image 20250420082448.png]]
	- What this area is showing is an area of where buying control came in.
	- When we have a HH and price corrects lower, the bottom of that correction is normally going to form a demand zone and price will consolidate a bit before making a large push to the upside.
	- If price continues the trend, you will see that the buyers are still in control because they have managed to push through the high and the trend is continuing.
	- Now that the buyers are in control, you can actually think where do the buyers enter the market? At the demand zone.

- What you're basically doing is following the volume & orders in the market by trading S&D.
	- If the buyers are in control, you can basically look for areas where they took that control and use that for future buys.

	- If the sellers are in control, you can basically look for areas where they took that control and use that for future sells.

###### Where do Supply & Demand zones form?

- At the bottom of movements and at the top of movements as well.

- Supply & Demand zones also form midway through an impulse move:

	- Let's say you're in an uptrend and price comes back down to retest a demand zone and continue pushing higher then we have a move a consolidation midway of the impulse move where the price pushes from.
	- The consolidation zone is regarded as the demand zone because its an area where the market reaccumulates.
	- When you get an area that forms before a BOS then this area is where you'd focus on as this is the area where buyers are coming in.
		![[Pasted image 20250420092640.png]]
		- Its an area where you've seen buyers buying in the past and its an area where buyers would like to get involved in.
		- You want to buy at the areas where the strongest moves are coming from.
		- If the initial demand zone isn't the one that breaks the structure, then you should be shifting your attention to the midway demand zone.

- You should generally be looking for the zones that broke the structure because that is the one where the strength is coming from.

###### Chart examples

- The general rule of plotting S&D zones is that you use the last bearish candle in a bullish zone and the last bullish candle in a bearish zone.

- Using dojis as S&D zones are essentially consolidations on lower timeframes.

- Don't use S&D zones that has been retested because it doesn't have as much power as one that was.

- The supply zone that was chosen was the one that broke structure:
	![[Pasted image 20250420122905.png]]

- Here you have a shift in structure from bearish to bullish which means that you should now look for demand zones.

	- Look for the zone that broke structure:

- Always opt for the S&D to be retested at the 50% mark, this doesn't apply to the lower timeframes such as the m1 & m5 timeframes.

###### Key factors to keep in mind:

- Always trade with the trend.

- S&D zones can used for targets.
