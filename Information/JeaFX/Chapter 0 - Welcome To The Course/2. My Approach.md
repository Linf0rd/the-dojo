- Unlearn what you know about trading in order to learn a new approach, this will give you a fresh outlook and perspective on the markets.

- Use a simplistic clean approach to fundamentals & technicals as its something that you have to do everyday.
	- There is no need to overcomplicate and confuse ourselves.

- Put a lot of emphasis on money management protocols as it is one of the most important aspects of trading.

- Psychology trumps everything, mindset is what is going to either allow you to follow or fail to follow trading processes, money management protocols, etc.
	- You need the psychology, we need the discipline and emotional control.


##### My Technical/Fundamental Trading Approach:

- 80/20 Approach: Where 80% is Technical/20% is Fundamental.

- Supply & Demand (This is why the market moves).

- Market Structure (Very Important!)

- Market Flow

- I focus on a few specific instruments: GBP, USD & XAU (I will expand once I gain more experience in my skillset).


##### My Trading Mindset:

- Strong psychology needed for discipline & emotional control.

- Consistent self development - building good habits (i.e. cleaning your space, working out, etc.).

- Having a growth mindset.
